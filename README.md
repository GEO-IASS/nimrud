# nimrud
nimrud is a point cloud classification toolkit which utilizes properties of local neighborhood
geometry (as well as other informational content) to assign class membership probabilities to 
individual points.
Some of the features implemented here are described in [my thesis](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/13097); others are currently undergoing active research.
